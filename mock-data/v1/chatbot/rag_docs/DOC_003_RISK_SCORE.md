# Risk Score (Mock)

`risk_score` is a synthetic 0–100 score for triage and demo purposes.

A high score typically correlates with:
- high predicted delay vs plan
- segments marked at_risk / disrupted
- severe news or weather tags (optional linkages)

In v1 mock, treat it as a ranking signal. Do not assume it is statistically calibrated.
