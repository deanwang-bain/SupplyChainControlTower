# Routing Playbook (Mock)

When asked for mitigations, the assistant can suggest:
- Mode shift: air ↔ sea ↔ road (with cost/time tradeoffs)
- Reroute: choose alternative segments with lower risk/variance
- Buffer: add safety stock or time buffer at high-variance nodes
- Split shipments: reduce exposure to a single disrupted lane

In v1 mock, these recommendations are heuristic and should cite the segments/news driving the suggestion.
