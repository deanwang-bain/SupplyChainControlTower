# Citation Rules

The chatbot should provide citations as [S1], [S2], etc.

A **Source** can be:
- A structured record: shipment, segment, entity, analytics series (include record ID)
- A news article (include URL)
- A RAG doc snippet (include doc name)

The UI should render a “Sources” list under each assistant message.
